##Numpy.ipynb:
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.

The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.

Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.

in this exercise, we'll focus on creting arrays


###EXERCISE-2
Array indexing is the same as accessing an array element.

You can access an array element by referring to its index number.

The indexes in NumPy arrays start with 0, meaning that the first element has index 0, and the second has index 1 etc.
this exercise is supposed to help in practising array indexing

##EXERCISE-3
Slicing in python means taking elements from one given index to another given index.

We pass slice instead of index like this: [start:end].

We can also define the step, like this: [start:end:step].

If we don't pass start its considered 0

If we don't pass end its considered length of array in that dimension

If we don't pass step its considered 1

Splitting is reverse operation of Joining.

Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple.

We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and the number of splits.

this exercise is a practice for array slicing and spliting.
